/*
Gradle build scripts are written in Groovy.
Groovy is a language that runs on JVM that fills a hole for Java developers who need a scripting language.
It is a terse, expressive, inter-operates extremely well with Java, and has some
special features that make it ideally suited for creating domain specific languages.

Declare a task called `groovy`
To run this script: $ gradle groovy
